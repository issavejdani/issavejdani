### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer specializing in creating documentation for software, APIs, and RESTful web services. I have experience in all aspects of technical writing and documentation, from designing the overall structure of a document to putting words on the page. Writing clear, understandable documentation for internal and external audiences is my superpower.

**I can help you revise the README file in your repository.**

I have been a developer in the past. I have experience programming in Java, C#, PHP, Python, and Javascript. 

I am currently looking for a job in the EU.
