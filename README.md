### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer(Technical writer) specializing in creating documentation for software, APIs, and RESTful web services. I have experience in all aspects of technical writing and documentation, from designing the overall structure of a document to putting words on the page. Writing clear, understandable documentation for internal and external audiences is my superpower.

**I can help you revise and proofread the README file in your repository.** Send me a message <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdi0tqCZWBHFzUsYFTzOdwW4PNQNjgNAeougrPehSFe4_M6nw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>.

I have been a developer in the past. I have experience programming in Java, C#, PHP, Python, and Javascript.
